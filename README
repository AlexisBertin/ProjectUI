------------------
 To add a project
------------------

1 - Add it in the 'index.html' in a new <article></article> tab
2 - Add a data file in 'projectsData/' with an other data file or with 'projectsData/_model.html' as a model.
3 - Add the project folder in 'projects/'


/!\ - Be careful with case sensivity in the name on the folders, IDs.. etc
	- Better have no capital letter in folder's name and in the .html to avoid any problem.
